ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Nic Lin â€” a protocol researcher and smart contract engineer focused on L2s, MEV, and secure protocol design. Iâ€™ve worked on core infrastructure in the Ethereum ecosystem, including account abstraction, rollups, and MEV-aware DEXs. I publish research-backed insights, contribute to open-source tooling, and speak at global Ethereum conferences. Currently exploring new frontiers in universal account, L1/L2 interoperability and censorship resistance.
